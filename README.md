# CryptoOffice

## Office Open XML (OOXML) formats (.xlsx, .docx, .pptx) decryption for Swift

CryptoOffice is a library for decrypting Microsoft Office formats that utilise
[ECMA-376 agile encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-offcrypto/cab78f5c-9c17-495e-bea9-032c63f02ad8). It should be used in conjuction
with libraries that allow parsing decrypted data, such as
[CoreXLSX](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX).

## Example

Using CryptoOffice is easy:

1. Add `import CryptoOffice` at the top of a relevant Swift source file.
2. Use `CryptoOfficeFile(path: String)` to create a new instance with a path to your encrypted file.
3. Call `decrypt(password: String)` on it to get decrypted data.
4. Parse the decrypted data with a library appropriate for that format
   ([CoreXLSX](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX) in this example).

```swift
import CoreXLSX
import CryptoOffice

let encryptedFile = try CryptoOfficeFile(path: "./categories.xlsx")
let decryptedData = try encryptedFile.decrypt(password: "pass")
let xlsx = try XLSXFile(data: decryptedData)

for path in try xlsx.parseWorksheetPaths() {
  let worksheet = try xlsx.parseWorksheet(at: path)
  for row in worksheet.data?.rows ?? [] {
    for c in row.cells {
      print(c)
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

**Apple Platforms**

- Xcode 11.0 or later
- Swift 5.1 or later
- iOS 13.0 / watchOS 6.0 / tvOS 13.0 / macOS 10.15 or later deployment targets

**Linux**

- Swift 5.1 or later

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies on all platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `CryptoOffice` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/CoreOffice/CryptoOffice.git",
           .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.1"))
]
```

If you're using CryptoOffice in an app built with Xcode, you can also add it as a direct
dependency [using Xcode's
GUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

## Contributing

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)
and [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to
enforce formatting and coding style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within
a local clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either
manually or automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.

To guarantee that these tools run before you commit your changes on macOS, you're encouraged
to run this once to set up the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook:

```
brew bundle # installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat and pre-commit
pre-commit install # installs pre-commit hook to run checks before you commit
```

Refer to [the pre-commit documentation page](https://pre-commit.com/) for more details
and installation instructions for other platforms.

SwiftFormat and SwiftLint also run on CI for every PR and thus a CI build can
fail with incosistent formatting or style. We require CI builds to pass for all
PRs before merging.
